Six months have passed since I completed the Millennium Fellowship, and I am proud to have been the Campus Director during my first year, leading 26 Millennium Fellows of 2022 Cohort. For those who are unfamiliar with the Millennium Fellowship, I recommend reading the blog written by my senior Niranjana, which covers all application procedures for both rounds.

### 2. Why do you want to be Campus Director?
```
Focus on your leadership capabilities when answering this question.
```
<u>Sample Answer</u>

This is a great opportunity for me, and I believe that I have a strong sense of leadership. I always strive for the best and try to make everything perfect. I am committed to my work and don't procrastinate. I would like to connect with similar people from other campuses and learn from them. That's why I'm interested in becoming the Campus Director. I also want to work on a team, learn soft skills, gain real-world leadership experience, improve my communication, time management, and responsibility skills. I can network with many people and create more friendships and bonds.

### 3. An instance where you worked along with someone as you have to work with two Campus Directors if you are getting selected.
<u>Sample Answer</u>

Collaboration and mutual support are paramount for a team. I was a team leader for a pitching competition where we needed to create an idea, study the revenue model, and pitch it. There were times when one of us couldn't be present physically and mentally, and other times we had a lot going on in our college and personal lives, making it hard to keep up. Good teamwork ensured that our project was submitted on time. When I did something right, they would congratulate me, and when something was wrong, they would say, "Let's fix it." It was a great experience.

### 4. An instance of a conflict you had in the team.
<u>Sample Answer</u>

We needed to submit an idea for a competition under the Kerala startup council, and my team discussed an idea and came to the conclusion that we would submit an idea about virtual reality for anxiety disorder. One team member wanted to cancel this idea at the very last moment, and he said he would quit if we didn't change the idea. The issue got bigger because we didn't have time to research a new topic and create a presentation. However, the other team members rejected his idea, and he went along with us. As the project continued, he became very uncomfortable and tried to initiate fights, and one day he said he wanted to leave the group because he couldn't keep up with his studies.
But as a leader, it was my duty to get to know what his problems were and think of a suitable solution. As we both sat down to have a good conversation, things got resolved quickly and he was willing to go with the project.

### 5. What will you do to make an interactive community?
<u>Sample Answer</u>

To make an interactive community, I would focus on creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone can share their ideas and opinions. I would organize team-building activities, encourage open communication, and promote collaboration. I would also try to create a sense of belonging by recognizing everyone's contributions and making sure everyone feels valued and appreciated.

### 6. How will you network and complete the tasks?
<u>Sample Answer</u>

To network and complete the tasks, I would use a variety of tools, such as social media, email, and phone calls, to communicate with my team and other Campus Directors. I would also prioritize tasks based on their importance and set clear deadlines to ensure that everything gets done on time. Additionally, I would delegate tasks to other team members based on their strengths and interests, which would help to ensure that everyone is engaged and motivated.

These are the list of some additional questions.
```
1. What are your greatest strengths?
2. Tell me about something you did - or failed to do - that you  now feel a little ashamed of.
3. Where do you see yourself five years from now?
4. Tell me a situation when your work was criticised.
5. Who has inspired you in your life and why?
``` 

### Final Thoughts
It's really a great opportunity for everyone to be part of Millennium Fellowship. With a leadership position like Campus Director, it will immensely boost your resume.

Thankyou and let's see in another blog where I will be sharing my experience as the Campus Director.
