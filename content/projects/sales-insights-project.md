## Description
In this project, I implemented a Tableau Dashboard uncovering sales order Insights. **ETL** (Extract Transformation and Load ), Data Cleaning was done.<br/>
Through this, Sales team will be able to make better decisions and prove better cost savings of total spend.<br/>
A Huge benefit is that Sales Analysts can stop data gathering manually in order to save time.
