## Problem Statement 
<strong>Subsidy Inc.</strong> is faced with the challenge of accurately determining the income of individuals in order to deliver subsidies. Obtaining precise income data is a complex task worldwide. However, Subsidy Inc. has acquired a substantial dataset comprising authenticated information on individual income, demographic factors, and select financial parameters.
<br/>
To address this issue, Subsidy Inc. aims to develop an <strong> income classifier system </strong>capable of accurately categorizing individuals based on their income levels. This system will leverage the available dataset to make reliable predictions and enable the efficient delivery of subsidies to those who qualify.
<br/>
By developing an effective income classifier system, Subsidy Inc. aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of their subsidy allocation process. This will empower them to allocate subsidies more equitably and ensure that individuals receive the appropriate financial assistance based on their income levels.
