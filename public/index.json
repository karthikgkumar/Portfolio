[{"content":"\rAs a developer, I\u0026rsquo;m constantly looking for ways to bridge the gap between human creativity and the efficiency of technology. One area ripe for disruption: presentations. We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there - staring down a blank slide deck, overwhelmed by the prospect of transforming a complex topic into engaging visuals.\nThis is where my latest project comes in - an AI presentation assistant designed to empower anyone to create impactful presentations.\nThe Spark of Inspiration The seed for this project was sown from witnessing countless colleagues struggle with the presentation creation process. The common complaints? Lack of inspiration, difficulty finding engaging visuals, and the sheer time investment required.\nI envisioned a tool that could streamline this process, allowing users to focus on the content while the AI handled the design elements.\nThe \u0026lsquo;create_presentation\u0026rsquo; Tool How one can utilise the tool? The core functionality of my AI assistant lies within the create_presentation tool. This tool takes several user-defined arguments to tailor the presentation to their specific needs: Topic: The main subject of the presentation Format: Choose between generating slides or a PDF document Number of Slides: Select the desired number of slides/pages (limited to 1-10 for optimal content density) Theme: For presentations (slides), users can personalize the look and feel with various themes like light, dark, professional, creative, minimalist, or tech (default theme is light)\nShow, Don\u0026rsquo;t Tell: The Power of Example To showcase the tool\u0026rsquo;s capabilities, let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a user wants to create a presentation on \u0026ldquo;The History of Space Exploration.\u0026rdquo; Here\u0026rsquo;s how they might utilize the create_presentation tool:\ncreate a presentation on the topic The History of Space Exploration with 7 slides. This command would instruct the AI assistant to generate a 7-slide presentation with a captivating dark theme, perfect for highlighting the vastness and mystery of space.\nTailoring the Experience: A Spectrum of Themes Understanding the importance of visual appeal in presentations, I incorporated a range of theme options. Whether seeking a sleek, professional look or a vibrant, creative style, users have the flexibility to match the theme to their presentation\u0026rsquo;s goal.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ai_projects/ai-ppt-generator/","summary":"As a developer, I\u0026rsquo;m constantly looking for ways to bridge the gap between human creativity and the efficiency of technology.

For those who are unfamiliar with the Millennium Fellowship, I recommend reading the blog written by my senior Niranjana, which covers all application procedures for both rounds.\nüîó Millennium Fellowship: The Why and How As a guide for campus director interviews, I have compiled a list of questions to help shape your leadership skills. The answers should be based on your experiences, and if you have conducted any large events, you should definitely add them to your responses. 1. Introduce yourself. When introducing yourself, it\u0026#39;s best to use the third person. Practice this question thoroughly. Sample Answer\nThank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce. Karthik G Kumar is a first-year computer science student at Government Model Engineering College. He was born and brought up in Kerala. He has a keen interest in technology and social activities. He loves to share his knowledge and mentor others.üë®‚Äçüè´ His dream is to provide educational opportunities to the underprivileged ones. He is a Data Analyst and an aspiring Data Scientist. A charismatic Karthik will never fail to impress you with two W\u0026rsquo;s ie Words and Work.‚ú® He is passionate on solving real-world problems with his technical skills. He loves networking with new people, anchoring, speaking and mentoring. He always keep one quote dear to his heart.\n\u0026ldquo;The more I want to get something done the less I call it work\u0026rdquo;.\nHe is a creative and hard-working person who constantly likes to learn new things and explore new cultures through language, food, and music. He likes to see himself as an optimist.\n2. Why do you want to be Campus Director? Focus on your leadership capabilities when answering this question. Sample Answer\nThis is a great opportunity for me, and I believe that I have a strong sense of leadership. I always strive for the best and try to make everything perfect. I am committed to my work and don\u0026rsquo;t procrastinate. I would like to connect with similar people from other campuses and learn from them. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m interested in becoming the Campus Director. I also want to work on a team, learn soft skills, gain real-world leadership experience, improve my communication, time management, and responsibility skills. I can network with many people and create more friendships and bonds.\n3. An instance where you worked along with someone as you have to work with two Campus Directors if you are getting selected. Sample Answer\nCollaboration and mutual support are paramount for a team. I was a team leader for a pitching competition where we needed to create an idea, study the revenue model, and pitch it. There were times when one of us couldn\u0026rsquo;t be present physically and mentally, and other times we had a lot going on in our college and personal lives, making it hard to keep up. Good teamwork ensured that our project was submitted on time. When I did something right, they would congratulate me, and when something was wrong, they would say, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s fix it.\u0026rdquo; It was a great experience.\n4. An instance of a conflict you had in the team. Sample Answer\nWe needed to submit an idea for a competition under the Kerala startup council, and my team discussed an idea and came to the conclusion that we would submit an idea about virtual reality for anxiety disorder. One team member wanted to cancel this idea at the very last moment, and he said he would quit if we didn\u0026rsquo;t change the idea. The issue got bigger because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to research a new topic and create a presentation. However, the other team members rejected his idea, and he went along with us. As the project continued, he became very uncomfortable and tried to initiate fights, and one day he said he wanted to leave the group because he couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep up with his studies. But as a leader, it was my duty to get to know what his problems were and think of a suitable solution. As we both sat down to have a good conversation, things got resolved quickly and he was willing to go with the project.\n5. What will you do to make an interactive community? Sample Answer\nTo make an interactive community, I would focus on creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone can share their ideas and opinions. I would organize team-building activities, encourage open communication, and promote collaboration. I would also try to create a sense of belonging by recognizing everyone\u0026rsquo;s contributions and making sure everyone feels valued and appreciated.\n6. How will you network and complete the tasks? Sample Answer\nTo network and complete the tasks, I would use a variety of tools, such as social media, email, and phone calls, to communicate with my team and other Campus Directors. I would also prioritize tasks based on their importance and set clear deadlines to ensure that everything gets done on time. Additionally, I would delegate tasks to other team members based on their strengths and interests, which would help to ensure that everyone is engaged and motivated.\nThese are the list of some additional questions.\n1. What are your greatest strengths?\r2. Tell me about something you did - or failed to do - that you now feel a little ashamed of.\r3. Where do you see yourself five years from now?\r4. Tell me a situation when your work was criticised.\r5. Who has inspired you in your life and why? Final Thoughts It\u0026rsquo;s really a great opportunity for everyone to be part of Millennium Fellowship. With a leadership position like Campus Director, it will immensely boost your resume.\nThankyou and let\u0026rsquo;s see in another blog where I will be sharing my experience as the Campus Director. üëã\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/millennium-fellowship/","summary":"Six months have passed since I completed the Millennium Fellowship, and I am proud to have been the Campus Director during my first year, leading 26 Millennium Fellows of 2022 Cohort.

We just need to have the degree of the polynomial and enter the coefficients. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that right? But is that memory efficient?ü§î Nope, because there would be spaces wasted. Wait a minute! But what\u0026rsquo;s a polynomial? Yes! you got it right. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive deep into this!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a polynomial? A polynomial p(x) is the expression in variable x which is in the form , where a, b, c ‚Ä¶., k fall in the category of real numbers and \u0026rsquo;n\u0026rsquo; is a non-negative integer, which is called the degree of a polynomial. For an algebraic expression to be a polynomial, all of the exponents in it must be non-negative integers. If an algebraic expression contains a radical, it isn\u0026rsquo;t a polynomial, as a general rule.\nAn essential characteristic of the polynomial is that each term in the polynomial expression consists of two parts:\none is the coefficient other is the exponent For example, ${5x^2+2x+3}$ Here,2 is the degree of the polynomial.\ncoefficients of = 5,2 exponents=2,1 Representation of a polynomial can be done in two ways Arrays Linked Lists In part 1, we will be talking about representation using arrays. The operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, differentiation and so forth can be performed on the polynomials represented as arrays.\nALGORITHM\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the algorithm of polynomial addition where we can learn how to represent a polynomial using an array and add two polynomials and store the result in the same array itself.\nThe algorithm works by comparing terms from the two polynomials until one or both polynomials become empty.\nThe comparison is performed and the result is added to the resultant polynomial.\nIf one of the polynomials becomes empty, the remaining terms from the other polynomial is copied to the sum polynomial.\nC IMPLEMENTATION #define MAXTERMS 100\rtypedef struct{\rfloat coeff;\rint expon;\r}polynomial;\rpolynomial terms[MAXTERMS];\rint avail=0; Here, we have added a structure consisting of coefficient and exponent of polynomial.avail which points the available is set to 0.
